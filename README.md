# excel-to-impex
A script written in java to pick the necessary values and creates a file called impex which is used for data immigration.

An executable JAR is created after the maven package operation. 

Script has two working modes: normal and batched. In order to enable batch mode use "-b" flag while executing the jar file.

You can see my coding convention and techniques through this code.
